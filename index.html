    <br><h3>What is Bowling?</h3>
    <p class="p1">If you haven’t played 10-pin bowling before, here's how it works. Ten pins stand in a triangular array 60 feet away from you. Between you and the pins, there’s an oiled wooden lane that’s 41.5 inches wide. You have a ball a little less than 9 inches in diameter that weighs up to 16 pounds. Your goal is to roll your ball down the lane and knock down as many pins as you can.</p>

            <p>Bowling is thought to have existed in England and the Netherlands around 1100 A.D. 
                In the early 1600s, as the Dutch colonized the Americas and established the city of New Amsterdam 
                (currently New York), they introduced the sport to the United States, where it was played using nine 
                pins assembled into a diamond shape.</p>

            <p>In 1511, English King Henry VIII was an avid bowler. He banned bowling for the lower classes and imposed a levy for private 
            lanes to limit them to the wealthy. Another English law, passed in 1541 (repealed in 1845), 
            prohibited workers from bowling, except at Christmas, and only in their master's home and in his presence.</p>

           <p>Rules for target bowls evolved separately in each of the other countries that adopted the predominantly British game. 
            In 1905, the International Bowling Board was formed; its constitution adopted the laws of the Scottish Bowling Association, 
            with variations allowed at the individual country level.</p>

    <p class="p2"> The earliest known forms of bowling date back to ancient Egypt, 
        with wall drawings depicting bowling being found in a royal Egyptian tomb 
        dated to 5200 BC and miniature pins and balls in an Egyptian child's grave about 5200 BC.
         Remnants of bowling balls were found among artifacts in ancient Egypt going back to the Egyptian protodynastic period in 3200 BC.
          What is thought to be a child's game involving porphyry (stone) balls, a miniature trilithon, 
          and nine breccia-veined alabaster vase-shaped figures—thought to resemble the more modern game of skittles—was found in Naqada,
           Egypt in 1895.</p>
